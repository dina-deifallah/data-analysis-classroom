       "array([\"I very rarely leave reviews and if I do, they're almost never negative but I feel compelled in this instance, as the Spotify app has got to be the worst app I have ever used. I'm on pay as you go with no Internet access unless I'm on Wi-Fi and all I use this app for is to listen to podcasts which I download in full before my work commute. It's obvious it simply has not been designed with any consideration for a user like myself. I would go as far as to state that it's terrible for podcasts in general, regardless of how you use your phone. To give you some examples: 1. When I'm at work, my phone will connect to the work Wi-Fi. There's an internal authorisation process to let devices use Internet when on the company network. What happens is that I can't play any podcasts if my phone's Wi-Fi is on - I press the play button, but nothing happens. I have two phones, one authorised to use the network and one not and this happens on both of them. I think what is taking place in the first instance is that our heavily filtered network will not let Spotify download ads and it completely throws it out of the loop. In the second instance, I think even though my phone is well aware it has no Internet access (despite being connected to Wi-Fi), Spotify ignores this fact and still tries to download ads before playing my podcasts. So every time I'm still within the huge range of my company's Wi-Fi, I need to disable my phone's Wi-Fi before I can play my podcasts for the commute home. After they start playing, I'm free to switch the Wi-Fi back on. But this isn't even the worst that this app does. 2. Quite frequently, right when I leave my company's Wi-Fi range (it always happens at almost the exact spot down to a few meters), the podcast that is being currently played will stop, losing its progress and the next one on the list will start playing. This is especially aggravating when I'm in the car and switching back to the podcast I was listening to and then finding the exact spot where I finished is impossible to do safely without stopping somewhere. But this still isn't the worst of it. 3. Recently the app started to randomly show all of my podcasts as not downloaded or actually deleting them (I'm still not sure what exactly happens as this only occurred 3 times so far, but all instances within the last month). The first time it happened, I've noticed as I walked out the door for work that my podcasts were gone. I had to redownload them all before leaving - I'm fortunate enough to be in a position where my bosses don't care what time I clock in but otherwise I'd probably by quite irritated. The next couple times it happened as I was trying to play my podcasts on my way home from work - but in those cases, when I got home, they annoyingly again started showing as downloaded and I could play them with no problems. Mind you, I have 40GB of free storage on my phone. And then there's the absolutely shockingly unusable and ugly interface (but I suppose it does fit the terrible Spotify logo). Manually removing a downloaded podcast from my playlist and downloads is an unintuitive multi-step process. I can't even change the order my podcasts will play in once they're on my playlist. I couldn't find a way to loop the playlist either, so if the last episode on your playlist is the first one you'll want to play, then you'll have to manually start the list from the top once it finishes. It can be supper annoying if this happens when you're on a motorway. It's like whoever created this app hasn't actually used it. It just blows my mind that a company as big as Spotify can't make an app that works, is usable and doesn't look like it was designed in Excel (actually, you can do much prettier things in Excel than that).\"],\n",
